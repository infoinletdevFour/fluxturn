## What is FluxTurn?

FluxTurn is a **production-ready, open-source workflow automation platform** that bridges the gap between idea and execution. Built for developers, DevOps teams, and technical users, FluxTurn combines the power of AI-driven workflow generation with a sophisticated visual builder to help you automate complex processes in seconds instead of hours.

Unlike traditional automation tools that require extensive configuration or low-code platforms that sacrifice flexibility, FluxTurn gives you the best of both worlds: the speed of natural language workflow generation and the precision of a visual node-based editor.

  <em>FluxTurn's visual workflow builder showing an AI agent workflow with chat memory</em>
</p>

### How It Works

1. **Describe Your Workflow** -- Tell FluxTurn what you want to automate in plain English
2. **AI Generates the Flow** -- Our AI agent analyzes your requirements and creates a complete workflow with the right connectors
3. **Visual Refinement** -- Fine-tune the generated workflow using our ReactFlow-powered canvas
4. **Deploy & Monitor** -- Execute workflows in real-time with detailed logging and WebSocket-based monitoring

### Key Capabilities

- **🤖 AI Workflow Generation** -- Describe what you want in plain English, get a working workflow with proper error handling and best practices
- **🎨 Visual Workflow Builder** -- Drag-and-drop interface powered by ReactFlow with real-time validation
- **🔌 120+ Pre-Built Connectors** -- Slack, Gmail, Shopify, HubSpot, Jira, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, and many more
- **⚡ Real-Time Execution** -- Watch workflows run with detailed logs, WebSocket updates, and performance metrics
- **🏠 Self-Hosted & Privacy-First** -- Run on your own infrastructure with Docker, full data control
- **🌍 Multi-Language Support** -- 17 languages including English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and more
- **🔄 Production-Ready** -- Built with NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Qdrant for enterprise-scale deployments

## What Problem We Solve

### The Automation Dilemma

Modern teams face a critical challenge: **automation is essential but time-consuming**. Building integrations between tools, handling errors, and maintaining workflows requires significant engineering resources.

**Common pain points we address:**

- ❌ **Manual Integration Hell** -- Writing custom scripts to connect different APIs takes hours or days
- ❌ **Expensive SaaS Lock-In** -- Commercial automation tools charge per workflow execution or user seat
- ❌ **Limited Flexibility** -- Low-code platforms are easy to start but hard to customize for complex use cases
- ❌ **Vendor Dependency** -- Cloud-only solutions mean you don't own your automation logic or data
- ❌ **Steep Learning Curve** -- Traditional workflow engines require deep technical knowledge to set up

### FluxTurn's Solution

✅ **AI-Powered Speed** -- Turn ideas into working workflows in seconds, not hours
✅ **Open Source Freedom** -- No vendor lock-in, no per-execution fees, full control over your code
✅ **Self-Hosted Privacy** -- Keep sensitive data and workflows on your infrastructure
✅ **Developer-Friendly** -- Full API access, extensible connector system, TypeScript codebase
✅ **Visual + Code** -- Start with AI generation, refine visually, export as code if needed
